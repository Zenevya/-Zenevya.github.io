The Personified Chess Piece Animation project aims to bring a unique and engaging twist to the traditional game of chess by infusing each piece with distinct personalities and creating scenes that play out when pieces are captured. This project combines elements of storytelling, and game design to create a dynamic and immersive chess experience.
